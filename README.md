# Forward-Kinematics-Visualization-Tool
This is a tool I wrote in python to help when creating a forward kinematic model for robotic arms

The visualizer takes a list of transofrmation matrices and plots the points relative to the base frame. This allows you to visualize the effects of each transformation. It shows the placement and orientation of each DH frame for each joint of the robot. It also displays the X, Y, and Z vectors to show the rotation of each frame. Finally, there is a gray line that connects each from to outline what the robot will look like.

When compare with the simulation it is easy to see how these frames line up with the actual robot. Below are 2 more examples of possible positions for the arm. <br>
